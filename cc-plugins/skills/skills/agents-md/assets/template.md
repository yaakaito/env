## Core Principles

- Correspond to the current codebase, data, and terminology over theory or general practices; always review thoroughly
- Choose simple over easy; prefer clarity over cleverness

- Write comments that explain Why, not What
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Remove unused code and arguments immediately
- Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages unless otherwise instructed
- [Add project-specific items as needed]
