# Browser Session Management

Run multiple isolated browser sessions concurrently with state persistence.

## Named Browser Sessions

Use `-s` flag to isolate browser contexts:

```bash
# Browser 1: Authentication flow
playwright-cli -s=auth open https://app.example.com/login

# Browser 2: Public browsing (separate cookies, storage)
playwright-cli -s=public open https://example.com

# Commands are isolated by browser session
playwright-cli -s=auth fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli -s=public snapshot
```

## Browser Session Isolation Properties

Each browser session has independent:
- Cookies
- LocalStorage / SessionStorage
- IndexedDB
- Cache
- Browsing history
- Open tabs

## Browser Session Commands

```bash
# List all browser sessions
playwright-cli list

# Stop a browser session (close the browser)
playwright-cli close                # stop the default browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession close   # stop a named browser

# Stop all browser sessions
playwright-cli close-all

# Forcefully kill all daemon processes (for stale/zombie processes)
playwright-cli kill-all

# Delete browser session user data (profile directory)
playwright-cli delete-data                # delete default browser data
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data   # delete named browser data
```

## Environment Variable

Set a default browser session name via environment variable:

```bash
export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION="mysession"
playwright-cli open example.com  # Uses "mysession" automatically
```

## Common Patterns

### Concurrent Scraping

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Scrape multiple sites concurrently

# Start all browsers
playwright-cli -s=site1 open https://site1.com &
playwright-cli -s=site2 open https://site2.com &
playwright-cli -s=site3 open https://site3.com &
wait

# Take snapshots from each
playwright-cli -s=site1 snapshot
playwright-cli -s=site2 snapshot
playwright-cli -s=site3 snapshot

# Close only the sessions created above
playwright-cli -s=site1 close
playwright-cli -s=site2 close
playwright-cli -s=site3 close
```

### A/B Testing Sessions

```bash
# Test different user experiences
playwright-cli -s=variant-a open "https://app.com?variant=a"
playwright-cli -s=variant-b open "https://app.com?variant=b"

# Compare
playwright-cli -s=variant-a screenshot
playwright-cli -s=variant-b screenshot
```

### Persistent Profile

By default, browser profile is kept in memory only. Use `--persistent` flag on `open` to persist the browser profile to disk:

```bash
# Use persistent profile (auto-generated location)
playwright-cli open https://example.com --persistent

# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open https://example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
```

## Default Browser Session

When `-s` is omitted, commands use the default browser session:

```bash
# These use the same default browser session
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close  # Stops default browser
```

## Browser Session Configuration

Configure a browser session with specific settings when opening:

```bash
# Open with config file
playwright-cli open https://example.com --config=.playwright/my-cli.json

# Connect through the browser extension
playwright-cli open --extension

# Open with specific browser
playwright-cli open https://example.com --browser=firefox

# Open in headed mode
playwright-cli open https://example.com --headed

# Open with persistent profile
playwright-cli open https://example.com --persistent
```

## Cleanup scope

Close sessions created for the task unless the user needs to keep them open. Use the same session name as the preceding actions:

```bash
playwright-cli -s=auth close
playwright-cli -s=public close
```

`close-all` and `kill-all` affect other sessions too. Use them only when the task covers those sessions. `delete-data` removes the profile directory; use it only when deleting that session's saved data is intended.

Use a custom `--profile` directory only when explicitly requested.
